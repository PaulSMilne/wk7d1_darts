# Week 7, Day 1: Darts ranking Java app

Assigned at 15.30 on Monday the 7th November.

Had a bit of bother with first creating this readme on the remote repository. Rather than set up a pull request I just started again. No harm done so far.

The initial instructions for setting up the classes seem clear enough.
