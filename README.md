# Week 7, Day 1: Darts ranking Java app

Assigned at 15.30 on Monday the 7th November.

Had a bit of bother with first creating this readme on the remote repository. Rather than set up a pull request I just started again. No harm done so far.

The initial instructions for setting up the classes seem clear enough.

Monday evening, 2300. It's taken me all evening but I've managed to do the MVP. Again my instinct was to do more, to add a way of sorting a random list into the right order, then a way of assigning a ranking based on the player's position on the board, but I did neither in the end. 

I'll have a quick look at finding a player by their name as I think it's similar to the rather clunky way I returned the player by their rank.

Okay, I've managed to do that as well, so chuffed. I'll take a quick look at the last item but won't spend too long trying to work it out.
